I've fallen in love with New York City and am hoping to live there after I graduate in May of 2020. I've been coding since high school and am so excited to be beginning my career as a software engineer. I give my all to everything that I do whether that be my school work, my job, or my hobbies. In my freetime, I love to run marathons, do yoga, and cook yummy vegan meals.</p><p>In my past internships I've gained a wide variety of experience. At Capital One I learned what it's like to work within an agile team and I loved it! It was so exciting and rewarding to contribute meaningful code to the consumer-facing application. Prior to that, my experience was within start-up companies. There, I was able to contribute to a variety of aspects of business spanning research, marketing, design and web development. I've gained so much from these summers and am thrilled to continue growing in my career as a developer.</p><p class="blog-shout-out">Want to learn more about me and my interests? <a href="blog.html">Check out my blog!</a></p></div>

            <div class="work-desc"><p>As part of the Technology Intern Program, I was fully immersed in the work of a development team. I learned React and improved my fluency in JavaScript, practiced the agile methodology and learned what it is like to develop for a large technology company. <br><br>During my 10 weeks as an intern, I was tasked with developing a new feature for Capital One's credit card application. For this project, I met with various teams to discuss the requirements for this feature, made changes to the design for consistency and developed the feature from scratch in React with Redux. As the lead developer for this feature, I created unit tests, organized code reviews and was wholly responsible for my code. Outside of my intern project, I was involved with the core of my team's work taking on stories each sprint. From these I learned about AB testing features in production, tracking interaction with the UI, and the scripts that monitor the application in production and alert the engineers if anything goes wrong. I've learned so much and feel that not only have I grown as an engineer but also that I've made significant contributions to my team at Capital One.</p></div>

            <div class="work-desc"><p>HackCville's Launch Academy is a prestigious 12-week summer program that teaches students hands-on skills that they can apply during a 7-week internship at the end of the summer. As a web design student, I participated in an intense 5-week training program where I learned to use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as well as in-depth design principles, wireframing tools, git and GitHub, and Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Figma, Sketch, and inVision. I also learned the basics of PHP, custom content management systems (CMS) with WordPress, and MySQL.<br><br>

            These skills enable me to quickly design, build, and launch beautiful and functional websites. I practiced what I learned by engaging in multiple hands-on projects built into Launchs curriculum. </p> </div>
