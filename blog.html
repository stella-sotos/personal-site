        <div class="blog-content">
          Recruiting is stressful! I've been figuring out where I'll be working full-time since July - JULY! It's the end of October now, and at last I know where I'm ending up. It wasn't easy getting here, but now that I'm on the otherside, I thought I'd share my experiences.<br><br>
          I started off in a good spot - I loved my internship and was lucky enough to receive a return offer. From there I narrowed my search to companies I would consider going to over Capital One. In the summer, I started reaching out to my network including any recruiters I had spoken to during my internship search and friends who worked or interned at companies I was interested in. I'm still pretty connected to many of my high school classmates which proved super helpful during this stage (shoutout TJHSST!).<br><br>
          Soon enough, I was interviewing all over the place. Some companies required coding challenges, while others went straight to phone screens. Regardless, I had to seriously brush up on my technical interview skills. My primary resources were LeetCode for practice problems, the book, Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI), and the YouTube channel, Back To Back SWE. I focused mostly on improving my dynamic programming skills and algorithm knowledge, as well as just being quicker on my feet when it came to common types of interview questions. I visited a few companies on-site and I was surprised by how prepared I felt. However, I don't think it was my technical knowledge that ended up helping me get my offers, instead I believe it was my communication skills that gave me my edge. I talked my interviewers through each stage of my thought process, thouroughly tested my code over edge cases, and iterated as necessary. In one of my first interviews I was sure that I flunked the technical problem I was given, but at the very end my interviewer told me that she liked how I thought. I ended up getting that offer. Communication skills can make all the difference!<br><br>
          It was a lot to manage, but once I got through all my interviews I was so excited to receieve a few offers. The decision, on the other hand, started to get me down. I loved my internship at Capital One and they offered me a spot in New York, where I so badly wanted to be. On the other hand, I received incredible offers from Microsoft and Facebook. The opportunity for learning and growth at those companies would be hard to turn down. <... talk about actual decision> </div>

        <div class="blog-date">August 8, 2019</div>
        <div class="blog-content">I've had a wonderful experience during my 10-week software engineering internship at Capital One in the McLean headquarters. It was exciting to be fully integrated into an agile team and to release my own code to the consumer-facing credit card application. I couldn't believe how quickly I was able to make real contributions to projects that will have a significant impact on the business. I am also excited to share that I have recently received my certification as an Amazon Web Services Developer Associate. <br><br>Huge thank you to my team, the Mighty Minions, my manager, Khosro Akhavan Astaneh and my teammates: Derek Warren, James Guan, Isaac Cyril, Jun Li, Sunil Chakrahari, and Rabin Paudyal. This internship has allowed me to grow so much in both my technological and professional skills. Thank you again to my fantastic team and to Capital One for the amazing opportunity.</div>
