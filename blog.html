	        	Since I graduated (virtually) in May, I've struggled to fill up my now abundant free time. From bingeing seasons of Survivor to the endless scrolling of TikTok, the easy time-sucks pretty much sucked when it came to self-satisfaction. Luckily, my long time friend Juliana Bain offered up the perfect opportunity to get involved with something much more meaningful.

	        	<br><br>Juliana founded <a href="https://voteology.org/">Voteology</a> in an entrepreneurship class during her senior year at Cornell. After the controversial election of Donald Trump in 2016, Juliana saw that many of her peers felt like their votes didn't matter. Regardless of political orientation or candidates involved, so many students felt uninspired to vote. Juliana wanted to empower college students to use their voice and to take advantage of their special ability to vote in either their hometown or their college town. By comparing the race at home and at school, Voteology's non-partisan algorithm informs students where their vote carries the most weight - looking at how close the race is for the different elections in their districts. Voteology has also partnered with the Biden Digital Coalition to help amplify the mission and reach as many students as possible. Juliana asked me to be a part of Voteology's amazing, all-women board of advisors and to help the organization prepare for the presidential election this fall. 


	        	<br><br>Since joining Voteology, I've been able to stretch my brain by taking on the design for the Instagram account. Prior to this project, I'd worked on web design during my HackCville internship and had taken a digital media art class where I got to make some <a href="gallery-arts2220.html">funky projects discussing the environmental impact of animal agriculture</a>. I was excited to work on design in this new capacity, especially in an age where Instagram infographics were going viral left and right. I used Adobe Photoshop to create a series of square posts for Voteology's instagram with help from fellow board member Noe Abernathy with copy-writing for the posts. Starting with only 50 followers, it's been so fulfilling to watch our content be shared by hundreds and to see website sign-ups increase. I've featured a few of my favorite graphics below and check out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/voteologyorg/">@VoteologyOrg</a> on Instagram to see the latest posts with all your election updates!

        <div class="blog-content">
          Recruiting is stressful! I've been figuring out where I'll be working full-time since July - JULY! It's the end of October now, and at last I know where I'm ending up. It wasn't easy getting here, but now that I'm on the otherside, I thought I'd share my experiences.<br><br>
          I started off in a good spot - I loved my internship and was lucky enough to receive a return offer. From there, I narrowed my search to companies I would consider over Capital One. In the summer, I started reaching out to my network including any recruiters I had spoken to during my internship search and friends who worked or interned at companies I was interested in. I'm still pretty connected to many of my high school classmates which proved super helpful during this stage. I also attended the Grace Hopper Celebration in Orlando, Florida which was a great networking opportunity.<br><br>
          Soon enough, I was interviewing all over the place. Some companies required coding challenges, while others went straight to phone screens. Regardless, I had to seriously brush up on my technical interview skills. My primary resources were LeetCode for practice problems, the book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836">Elements of Programming Interviews</a>, and the YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJz2DV1a3yfgrR7GqRtUUA">Back To Back SWE</a>. I focused mostly on improving my dynamic programming skills and algorithm knowledge. All the practice also helped with being quicker on my feet when it came to common types of interview questions. I visited a few companies on-site and I was surprised by how prepared I felt. However, I don't think it was my technical knowledge that ended up helping me get my offers, instead I believe it was my communication skills that gave me my edge. I talked through each stage of my thought process, thouroughly tested my code over edge cases, and iterated as necessary. In one of my first interviews I was sure that I flunked the technical problem I was given, but at the very end my interviewer told me that she liked how I thought. I ended up getting that offer. Communication skills can make all the difference!<br><br>
          It was a lot to manage, but once I got through all my interviews I was so excited to receieve a few offers. The decision, on the other hand, started to get me down. I loved my internship at Capital One and they offered me a spot in New York, where I so badly wanted to be. On the other hand, I received incredible offers from Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. The opportunity for learning and growth at those companies would be hard to turn down. <br><br>Finally, after much deliberation, I am so excited to annouce that I will be joining Facebook as a Software Engineer in the fall of 2020. I'll be located in Seattle, Washington and I couldn't be more excited for what's to come. </div>

        <div class="section-title"><h2>My Grace Hopper Experience</h2></div>
        <div class="blog-date">October 5, 2019</div>
        <div class="blog-content">The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women In Computing is a 4-day event held every year. The conference aims to inspire and empower young women entering the tech industry through speakers, events, mentoring, and a massive career fair. I attended this year's event from October 1-4 in Orlando, Florida. <br><br>
        I was lucky enough to receive a sponsorship to attend through my school, the University of Virginia, since event registration alone costs hundreds of dollars not to mention the costs of flights and hotels. I planned my trip back in July, when I had barely begun recruiting for full-time positions with no idea of where I would be in the process months later in October. When I registered, I uploaded my resume to the GHC career portal and soon companies began contacting me. Although I had no interviews at GHC, I did receive invites to various companies' events. <br><br>
        Fast forward to the week of the event and I was already deep in the recruiting process with a few offers under my belt. I faced Grace Hopper with the goal of connecting with a few specific companies. I spent the majority of GHC at the incredible carreer fair, waiting in lines to speak with recruiters and learn about the opportunities at these companies (and collecting some cool swag along the way!). I gave these recruiters my resume and pitched myself to them. I made sure to ask about what the next steps would be and if they could work within my approaching offer deadline. I came away from this with a some new LinkedIn connections and some new leads on exciting jobs.<br><br>
        One of the the best aspects of Grace Hopper was being able to reconnect with some of my best friends from high school and my internships. It was awesome to meet up with everyone again, share our experiences with recruiting, and offer eachother advice. I went to a Capital One event and it was great to see all of my intern friends, my recruiter, and everyone else from the summer. I also spent an evening at Disney World's Magic Kingdom with my best friend from high school. It was amazing to have a whole network of women in tech surrounding me.<br><br>
        My week at the Grace Hopper Celebration was well worth the school I missed. I had so much fun in Orlando and made and strengthened many valuable connections with fellow women in tech. I hope I'm able to attend next year - hopefully from the other side, helping the next class of young women.

        <div class="blog-date">August 8, 2019</div>
        <div class="blog-content">I've had a wonderful experience during my 10-week software engineering internship at Capital One in the McLean headquarters. It was exciting to be fully integrated into an agile team and to release my own code to the consumer-facing credit card application. I couldn't believe how quickly I was able to make real contributions to projects that will have a significant impact on the business. I am also excited to share that I have recently received my certification as an Amazon Web Services Developer Associate. <br><br>Huge thank you to my team, the Mighty Minions, my manager, Khosro Akhavan Astaneh and my teammates: Derek Warren, James Guan, Isaac Cyril, Jun Li, Sunil Chakrahari, and Rabin Paudyal. This internship has allowed me to grow so much in both my technological and professional skills. Thank you again to my fantastic team and to Capital One for the amazing opportunity.</div>
